## Task

Implement the basic functionality of the "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" game:

- The player answers one of 12 questions in turn.
- Each question has at least 4 answer options and at least one correct one.
- If the answer is correct, the player moves to the next question. If the answer is incorrect, the player goes to the final screen.
- The final screen should show the overall game result. The design for the layout is [provided](https://www.figma.com/file/tIZEZn2HTAeSDQRzoOzvXE/Front-end-test%2C-Headway). The layout should be adaptive.

## Requirements

- Use this [layout](https://www.figma.com/file/tIZEZn2HTAeSDQRzoOzvXE/Front-end-test%2C-Headway) for the layout.
- Make the layout adaptive (from iPhone 8 to 4k displays).
- Perform the layout without using CSS frameworks.
- The game configuration (questions, answers, money for the correct answer, etc.) should be in JSON format.
- The configuration should be extendable: more or fewer answer options for questions; several correct answers, etc.
- Place the result on GitHub with md-instructions for installation and launch.
- Complete the task using NextJs and deploy it on Vercel.
- All client code must fully comply with the "out of the box" eslint / airbnb rules.
- All client code should be fully typed using TypeScript.

## Flexibility Considerations

- Code that will be easy to expand and maintain.
- Architectural organization of the application.
- Correct handling of exceptional situations.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **State Manager**: Redux Toolkit(thunk, reselect)
- **Linting**: ESLint with Airbnb configuration
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Architecture**: FSD (Feature-Sliced Design)

## JSON Configuration Example

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "answers": [
      { "answer": "Berlin", "id": 1, "correct": false },
